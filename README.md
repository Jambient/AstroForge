  <i align="center">A game about building ships, fighting enemies, building more ships, and fighting more enemies.</i>

## Introduction

`AstroForge` is a game I made for my First Year Term 2 module named "C# Scripting For Engines". In the game the player can build ships using the different pieces provided such as blocks, weapons, thrusters, etc. They can then use this ship to fight enemies in a procedurally generated round based arena. There is also a sandbox mode where players can test out ship designs without worrying about the cost.
